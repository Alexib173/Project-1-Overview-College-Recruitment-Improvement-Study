# Project #1 Overview: College Recruitment Improvement Study

"How can you use Python to perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys?"

This project follows a structured, three-part process that guides us from formulating questions to presenting meaningful insights using Python and data visualization. In Part 1: Data Study Questions, we will develop key questions that focus our analysis, including both self-formulated and instructor-assigned questions. In Part 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning, we will examine the provided datasets—first in Excel for initial exploration, then in Python for deeper inspection—to identify and address missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant columns, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis. Finally, in Part 3: Data Analysis and Visualization, we will use the cleaned dataset to perform analyses that answer our study questions, employing Python’s plotting libraries to create clear, informative visualizations. All components of the project, including data, code, and results, will be documented and shared through a GitHub repository for organization and collaboration.


## 2 Data Science Questions

1. Which age groups are most interested in computing classes?
2. Why non-computing majors are taking computing classes as elective classes?
3. What percentage of non-computing majors are interested in taking more computing classes?
4. From which non-computing majors do the most students transfer into computing classes?

## Project Files


You can find 41 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. **Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv** is the CSV file of the data from Majors Survey Results. This file was not touched in any way, and it is the data that we will need to clean and analyze.
2. **cleaned_Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv** is the CSV file of the data from Majors Survey after cleaning. It was cleaned in the Project #1.ipynb file.
3. **Project #1.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that we ran to clean our survey data file (Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv) and it saved the cleaned CSV file as cleaned_Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv.
4. **Project #1_vizualization.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that analyzes the cleaned data in cleaned_Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv to answer the 4 data science questions. It showcases the commands used to clean up the data further for each question, plots the data in an easy to read format, and conducts an analysis for each of them, sometimes even adding more graphs and data analysis commands to create a better understanding or verify an analysis.
